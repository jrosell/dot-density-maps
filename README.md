# Dot-density maps

Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of dot density maps.

Dot density maps are like sprinkling magic dots across a map to reveal hidden patterns. Each dot represents a specific number of occurrences of something coolâ€”like population, housing density, or even crime rates. 

In today's tutorial, we'll roll up our sleeves and create 2D and 3D dot density maps using R, ggplot2, and rayshader.
